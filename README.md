<h2>What does it do?</h2>
<p>
  MWCLG is a simple tool for creating multiple WhatsApp chat links. 
  This tool allows you to start WhatsApp Web with the conversation
  open and the message pre-filled, ready to be sent using the 'Enter' key on your keyboard.
</p>
<p>
  You just need to input the desired 
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_country_calling_codes">country code</a>,
  any number of local numbers (each separated by a space or line break), and the message
  you want to be set for each conversation.

<h2>Why use this tool instead of WhatsApp Business Management API?</h2>
<p>In short: MWCLG is free and simple to use. Meta's API costs money and takes a long time to set up correctly.</p>
<p>
  Oh, so you kept reading! Okay, here's the long explanation: WhatsApp Business Management API has a lot of 
  <a href="https://developers.facebook.com/docs/whatsapp/business-management-api/get-started">requirements</a>,
  and the <a href="https://developers.facebook.com/docs/whatsapp/pricing/">pricing</a> is quite high, especially if
  you're contacting people outside the US. If your target audience is in Argentina, the cost is not only 250% higher than contacting
  people from the US, but if you actually live in Argentina, due to various government regulations, you'll spend 60% more
  on taxes since it's a foreign service (the same goes for Spotify, Netflix, YouTube, Steam, etc.) and you're paying in US dollarsâ€”which,
  due to certain economic factors, is even more expensive than it should be. But let's not dive into that!
