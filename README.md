<h2>What does it do?</h2>
<p>
  MWCLG is a simple tool for creating multiple WhatsApp chat links. 
  This tool allows you to open WhatsApp Web with a conversation ready and the message pre-filled, so it's ready to be sent using the 'Enter' key on your keyboard.
</p>
<p>
  You just need to input the desired 
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_country_calling_codes">country code</a>,
  any number of local numbers (each separated by a whitespace), and the message
  you want to set for each conversation.
</p>

<h2>Why use this tool instead of WhatsApp Business Management API?</h2>
<p>
  In short: MWCLG is free and simple to use. Meta's API costs money and takes a long time to set up properly.
</p>
<p>
  Oh, you're still reading? Okay, here's the long explanation: The WhatsApp Business Management API has a lot of 
  <a href="https://developers.facebook.com/docs/whatsapp/business-management-api/get-started">requirements</a>,
  and the <a href="https://developers.facebook.com/docs/whatsapp/pricing/">pricing</a> is quite high, especially if
  you're contacting people outside the US. If your target audience is in Argentina, the cost is not only 250% higher than contacting
  people in the US, but if you live in Argentina, due to various government regulations, you'll pay 60% more
  on taxes, since it's a foreign service (like Spotify, Netflix, YouTube, Steam, etc.), and it's billed in US dollars—which,
  due to certain economic factors, makes it even more expensive than it should be. But let’s not dive into that!
</p>

<h2>Personalized Conversations</h2>
<p>
  Another benefit of MWCLG is that it allows you to check if you've had a previous conversation with a contact and personalize your approach. 
  For example, if you've previously discussed a certain service or product, you can restart the conversation around that topic, making it more personal 
  instead of sending a "cold" template. This shows your audience that you genuinely care about them.
</p>
<p>
  Of course, you can also choose a more programmatic way to reach your audience, which I discuss in the section below.
</p>

<h2>Automate Further</h2>
<p>
  If you know a bit of programming, you can automate the process further with 
  <a href="https://pypi.org/project/PyAutoGUI/">PyAutoGUI</a> using Python or 
  <a href="https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo">Tampermonkey</a> using JavaScript.
